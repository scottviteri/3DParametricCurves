# 3D Parametric Curves

This project contains Python scripts to generate and visualize 3D parametric curves. It was created as part of a conversation with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

## Files

- `main_functions.py`: Contains the main function definitions and imports.
- `helpers.py`: Contains helper function definitions.
- `curves.py`: Contains curve definitions.

## Usage

You can run each file individually in a Python environment. The scripts are set up such that the necessary functions from `main_functions.py` and `helpers.py` are imported in `curves.py`. 

You can plot the curves by running `curves.py`:
